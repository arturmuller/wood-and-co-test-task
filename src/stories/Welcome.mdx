# Welcome

Hello there! Thank you for taking the time to complete this task! Please read
this entire document carefully -- it should contain everything you need to know
to complete this small component.

## Brief

Your task has two parts:

1. Take the code that is currently in the WoodAssetsOverview directory, and make
   sure that it conforms to the spec which is outlined below. You can these
   Storybook page during development: [Assets Overview stories](/docs/components-assets-overview--docs).
   Note that although the component overall is not complete, many things have already been
   addressed, for example some base styling. You don't need to change things
   that are working for you, but don't be afraid to challenge or change things
   that don't look right. Please note that **mobile styles/versions and info
   buttons (lowercase letter i in a circle) are not part of this task**. Feel
   free to simply ignore them.

2. Provide feedback to the junior developer where appropriate.

**Important:** If you're having issues completing the entirety of the spec, or
don't have time to provide feedback, don't stress. Just try to complete as much
as possible!

### Spec

The component is a horizontal slider of financial assets that a user sees on
their dashboard.

It looks like this:

![](/assets-overview.png)

More detail can be seen on the following [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/l9U3c4FeO4cDSh5c8bY3W2/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=LpSKZbRLAWAKxQrm-1).

Couple of important notes:

- The component should perfectly match Figma.
- The component can have two or more items. If there are two to four items,
  the items are simply shown as per Figma. Once there are five or more items,
  red arrow controls should appear on both sides of the component and the user
  should be able to use them to move from one item to the next in discrete
  steps.
- In addition to the arrows, users on devices that support touch should be able
  to simply scroll within the card from one card to another. Items should snap
  to the start of their 'box'. See CSS Scroll Snap below.
- No scrollbars should be visible.

### Limitations & Implementation Tips

Because we are in the middle of Vue2/Vue3 transition, we are severly limited
when it comes to the libraries we can use out of the box. For this reason, we
need this component completed without using external code. Luckily, modern
technologies make this very possible without a mountain of code.

You can use whatever APIs you want to complete this task, but here are some
recommendations:

- **CSS Scroll Snap** for inner scroll that snaps in discrete steps.
  [More on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap)
- **Intersection Observer** for tracking the visibility of rendered items. This
  is particularly helpful for deciding which arrows should be disabled and
  which should be interactive. [More in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
- DOM Element's `scrollIntoView` method can be useful for scrolling to an
  element within a scrollable container. [More on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView)

Good luck and looking forward to your submission!
